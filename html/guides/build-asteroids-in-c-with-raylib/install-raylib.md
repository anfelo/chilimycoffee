We will be building the game with [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) to
focus on the game itself and not worry about all the low level plumbing that
comes with trying opening a window and painting pixels into the screen.

Raylib has excelent support for multiplatform and has thorough documentation
on how to install it in any machine.

Make sure to check the [installation guide](/guides/my-game-engines-notes/raylib-installation) 
before you continue.
