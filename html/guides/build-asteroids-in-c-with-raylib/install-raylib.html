<h1>Install Raylib</h1>

<p>
  We will be building the game with
  <a href="https://www.raylib.com/index.html" target="_blank">Raylib</a> to
  focus on the game itself and not worry about all the low level plumbing that
  comes with trying opening a window and painting pixels into the screen.
</p>

<p>
  Raylib has excelent support for multiplatform and has thorough documentation
  on how to install it in any machine.
</p>

<p>
  Make sure to check the
  <a href="/guides/my-game-engines-notes/raylib-installation">installation guide</a>
  before you continue.
