<h3>Setup Environment</h3>

<p>
  Before we start coding the actual game we need to make sure that we have all
  the tools in place, installed in our computer.
</p>

<p>
  We will be making a game in C and for that to happen, our computer must be
  able to compile the code that we write. Luckily, almost every operating system
  comes with a C compiler installed that we can use. Depending on which
  operating system (OS) you are running on, you will use one or the other. But
  don't worry I will guide you through the entire process no matter what
  computer you are using.
</p>

<p>Let us first check that you are all set.</p>

<h3>macOS</h3>
<p>
    On macOS check that you have installed either clang or gcc:
</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code>clang --version</code></pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code>gcc --version</code></pre>

<p>
  If none of those is available in your machine, check the
  <a href="/guides/my-c-notes/installation#macos">installation guide</a>.
</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>TODO: Add the windows instructions.</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>
Check if clang or gcc are already installed in your system:
</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code>clang --version</code></pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code>gcc --version</code></pre>

<p>
  If none of those are installed in your Linux machine, check the
  <a href="/guides/my-c-notes/installation#linux">installation guide</a>.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  This is all that you will need for now, you are almost ready to start hacking.
  Now we will setup Raylib, a game library that will make our lives easier when
  trying to paint some pixels into the screen, and much more.
