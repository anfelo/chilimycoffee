<h3>Setup Environment</h3>

<p>
  Before we start coding the actual game we need to make sure that we have all
  the tools in place, installed in our computer.
</p>

<p>
  We will be making a game in C and for that to happen, our computer must be
  able to compile the code that we write. Luckily, almost every operating system
  comes with a C compiler installed that we can use. Depending on which
  operating system (OS) you are running on, you will use one or the other. But
  don't worry I will guide you through the entire process no matter what
  computer you are using.
</p>

<p>Let us first check that you are all set.</p>

<h3>macOS</h3>
<p>
  On macOS the C
  <a href="/guides/build-your-own-interpreter/what-are-compilers">compilers</a>
  are typically installed as part of the Xcode Command Line Tools. You have two
  options here.
</p>
<p>
  Clang (from the LLVM Project) is the default C, C++, and Objective-C compiler
  on macOS. It is included with the Xcode Command Line Tools. You can verify
  that it is installed by running:
</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code>$ clang --version</code></pre>

<p>
  The other alternative is GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) which can be installed
  using a package manager like <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> like this:
  <code>$ brew install gcc</code>
</p>

<p>Once installed you can verify the version by running on your terminal:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code>$ gcc --version</code></pre>

<p>
  If none of those is available in your machine, check the
  <a href="/guides/my-c-notes/installation#macos">installation guide</a>.
</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>TODO: Add the windows instructions.</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>
  In Linux it depends on the distribution but the most common one GCC
  (GNU Compiler Collection). It is the default compiler in most distros. Make
  sure that it is installed by running the following command:
</p>

<pre class="language-bash"><code>$ gcc --version</code></pre>

<p>
  An alternative would be clang from the LLVM Project.You can also check if it
  is installed:
</p>

<pre class="language-bash"><code>$ clang --version</code></pre>

<p>
  If none of those are installed in your Linux machine, check the
  <a href="/guides/my-c-notes/installation#linux">installation guide</a>.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  This is all that you will need for now, you are almost ready to start hacking.
  Now we will setup Raylib, a game library that will make our lives easier when
  trying to paint some pixels into the screen, and much more.
