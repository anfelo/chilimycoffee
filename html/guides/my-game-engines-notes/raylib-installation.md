# Installation

### macOS

The easiest way to install raylib in macOS is to use [Raylib's installation guides](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-macOS), they work like a charm and it has never been easier to get started. They now have a [Quick Start](https://github.com/raylib-extras/raylib-quickstart) project template that will setup your raylib environment in any platform. So make sure to follow the steps from the README file.
