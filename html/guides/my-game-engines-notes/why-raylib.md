# Why Raylib?

Raylib is an amazing library that allows you to create games primarily in C
and C++. However, there are other languages that have created bindings on top
of it.

Raylib is multiplatform. It is lightweight and the API is easy to use.

If you want to create a game with C or C++ and you don't want to get messy
with the nuances of painting pixels in different platforms, then Raylib is
perfect. It gives you the necessary tools to start programing your game right
away.
